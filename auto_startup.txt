ExecReload:- This is an optional field. It specifies how a service is restarted. 
For services that perform disk I/O (especially writing to disk, like a database), it is best to gracefully kill them and start again. 
Use this field in case you wish to have a specific restart mechanism.


Restart:- This is another optional field but one that you will very likely use. 
This specifies if a service should be restarted--depending on circumstances--or not. 
The available options are no, on-success, on-failure, on-abnormal, on-watchdog, on-abort and always.

the Type is "oneshot", systemd makes sure that no services are being started/stopped until our service is fully initialized or until our service has started.
